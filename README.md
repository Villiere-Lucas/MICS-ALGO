First commit. The code works for any large number. It converts these numbers into base 16 (so base 2^4), and it does an addition between these 2 numbers.  
Everything is work. (Conversion + Addition)  
For example, with the numbers:  
987465132231458794651328764548798465584794651184213465879465132 &  
159815623184651238994562989465289562895689465984659846598658465

We get in base 2^4 (16):  
26680457EF2C4402A13F0D64116AE8C01790F6E0789CF2C22CCAC &  
637419000953F486101CF0C65F76264292A226321DB0855E89A1

And the sum is:  
2C9F45E7EFC1834B0240DC7077624B2440BB19439A77FB181564D
